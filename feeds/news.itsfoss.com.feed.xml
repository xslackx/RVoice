The developers have included <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/ch05.html?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">Xwayland</a> so that users don&apos;t face any issues when running native X11 applications.</p><p>This move was something that the Raspberry Pi developers <strong>first considered 10 years ago</strong>, but at the time, Wayland had not matured enough for them to justify a complete switch.</p><p>Over the years, they started to experiment with it. They began in 2021 with the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-os-debian-bullseye/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Bullseye release</a>, switching to <a href="https://mutter.gnome.org/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Mutter</a> and using it as an X11 window manager with an optional Wayland mode.</p><p>Then, in 2023, with the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/bookworm-the-new-version-of-raspberry-pi-os/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Bookworm release</a>, they replaced Mutter with <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Wayfire</a>, and made the Wayland session the default one on the Raspberry Pi <a href="https://itsfoss.com/raspberry-pi-4/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">4</a> and <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/raspberry-pi-5/">5</a>, continuing to use the X11 session on weaker Raspberry Pi models.</p><p>After many extensive bouts of experimenting and testing, they found out that <strong>they were doing more harm than good</strong> and had to look for new solutions. That is when they found <a href="https://github.com/labwc/labwc?ref=news.itsfoss.com">labwc</a>, where, within hours of work, they were able to implement it into the Raspberry Pi OS.</p><p>They then collaborated with the developers of labwc and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">wlroots</a> (<em>a crucial component of labwc</em>) to further refine the Wayland experience for Raspberry Pi devices. They have now reached a stage where <strong>Raspberry Pi OS runs efficiently on both older and newer devices</strong> when using the Wayland session.</p><p>During the announcement, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-long-27127827/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Simon Long</a>, UX Lead at Raspberry Pi, added that:</p><blockquote>For most of this year, we have been working on porting labwc to the Raspberry Pi Desktop.

However, there is a more clear-cut issue at hand here.</p><p>The training methods and data used to train such proprietary and open weight models are never really shared openly, and we already know that there are plenty of copyrighted/IP-protected pieces of data in the outputs of such models.</p><p>The Open Source Initiative (OSI) had <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/osi-meta-ai/">called out Meta</a> on this recently, as they market the <a href="https://www.llama.com/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Llama</a> family of models as open source, which, in reality, is open weight at best.</p><p>Now, the <a href="https://opensource.org/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">OSI</a> has introduced the first version of the long-awaited <strong>Open Source AI Definition</strong> (OSAID), which aims to tackle such issues by defining the concept explicitly.</p><h2 id="open-source-ai-definition-what-to-expect">Open Source AI Definition: What To Expect?</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/10/OSAID_Banner.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Is The AI Open Source?

(<em>OpenAI doesn&apos;t seem to have collaborated</em>)</p><p>Without going too much into the technical aspects of the OSAID, here are some<strong> key points</strong> of the definition that you should be aware of:</p><ul><li>Anyone can use an open source AI system for any use case, study how it works, modify it according to one&apos;s needs, and should be able to share it freely with/without modifications for any purpose.</li><li>There is a precondition for the above, which is to have access to a &#x201C;<em>preferred form</em>&#x201D; to make modifications to the AI system.</li><li>The &#x201C;<em>preferred form</em>&#x201D; must include things like having access to the complete description of the data used for training, disclosure of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance?ref=news.itsfoss.com">provenance</a> of the data, listing of all publicly available data, and the source code used to train the AI system. Even the model parameter or configuration settings used are to be provided.</li></ul><p>To summarize, the definition covers all &#x201C;<em>fully functional structure and its discrete structural elements</em>&#x201D; under its purview. This includes things like <strong>the model, the weights, the parameters</strong>, etc.</p><p>This means that to meet the OSAID standards, an AI model&apos;s entire architecture, along with the smaller components that make it function, must be accessible and modifiable by anyone.</p><p>Additionally, the term &#x201C;AI system&#x201D; broadly covers any machine-based system that can take in inputs and generate outputs that affect physical or virtual environments for both <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/explicit-vs-implicit/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">explicit and implicit</a> objectives.</p><p>You can learn more about OSAID by going through <a href="https://opensource.org/ai/open-source-ai-definition?ref=news.itsfoss.com">the definition</a> itself.</p><h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3><p>There is an inescapable pain point here, which is that there is <strong>no clause that stipulates the training data itself be open sourced</strong>. This has led to many people questioning whether this definition truly encompasses the fundamental principles of open source when such a major part is left out.</p><p>The OSI is said to be working on updates and defining rules for the maintenance of the OSAID, but they have not clarified how they intend to handle the matter of open sourcing the training data.</p><p>But, of course, having this definition is better than not having a standard.</p><p>In any case, you can learn more about the OSAID by going through the <a href="https://opensource.org/deepdive?ref=news.itsfoss.com">deepdive</a> published by the OSI, which shows an overview of the processes and governance-related aspects of the initiative.</p><p><em>&#x1F4AC; What are your views on OSAID?

The first was the <strong>lack of contributions to the app</strong>, where only he and a handful of other people were contributing to the code.</p><p>The second was that <strong>Google&apos;s publishing policies were making it very difficult to publish the app on the Play Store</strong>. Earlier this year, the Syncthing app for Android <a href="https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-android/issues/2064?ref=news.itsfoss.com">was taken offline</a> on the platform due to inadequate communication by Google over the initial unpublishing of the app.</p><p>And, even when the maintainer tried his best to resolve issues, they kept rejecting the releases, resulting in a long chain of back-and-forth email conversations leading to nowhere.</p><p>Closing out the announcement, Simon added that:</p><blockquote>The app saw no significant development for a long time and without Play releases I do no longer see enough benefit and/or have enough motivation to keep up the ongoing maintenance an app requires even without doing much, if any, changes.<br><br>Thanks a lot to everyone who ever contributed to this app!</blockquote><p>Well, I do not think this is a one-off case, the Google Play Store has become more restrictive compared to what it was a long time back, citing security reasons. While that is a good thing, they should not lose their focus off quality developers on their platform.</p><h2 id="do-we-have-any-alternatives">Do We Have Any Alternatives?</h2><p>Well, you can get the most recent release of the Syncthing app for Android from <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">F-Droid</a> before the final release arrives in December. </p><p>But, if you are searching for alternatives, then the <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.catfriend1.syncthingandroid/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Syncthing-Fork</a> app might be the next best bet, as it is a direct fork of the original app with some additional improvements.</p><div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.catfriend1.syncthingandroid/?ref=news.itsfoss.com" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Syncthing-Fork (F-Droid)</a></div><p>On the other hand, if you are looking for an entirely different solution, then you might want to check out <a href="https://itsfoss.com/freefilesync/?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">FreeFileSync</a> and <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Rsync</a>.</p><p>Similarly, those looking to transfer files manually between two devices can go for <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/localsend/">LocalSend</a>.

After MALIBAL had a conversation with him, it was found that the developer was only working a few hours a day in the office.</p><p>Following some back and forth, MALIBAL decided to move away from 9Elements and <a href="https://portal.malibal.com/kb/a1060/why-dont-you-ship-to-germany/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">banned</a> Germany, no longer shipping MALIBAL products to the country.</p><p>They then moved to another consultant, <a href="https://3mdeb.com/?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">3MDeb</a> (<em>based out of Poland</em>), where they encountered similar issues with delays and some pricey quotes for their <a href="https://www.dasharo.com/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Dasharo</a> product.</p><p>Furthermore, the non-branded implementation of such a customized firmware project was said to result in <strong>even greater expenditures</strong>. After disagreements on ethical and pricing grounds, MALIBAL moved away from 3MDeb and banned <a href="https://portal.malibal.com/kb/a1061/why-dont-you-ship-to-poland/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Poland</a> for life.</p><p>Eventually, they raised a complaint with coreboot <a href="https://www.coreboot.org/leadership.html?ref=news.itsfoss.com">leadership</a> to see if they could help them out with their predicament. First, they had a conversation with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhendrix/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">David Hendricks</a>, who reportedly said that they (<em>the leadership</em>) cannot dictate terms to the coreboot consultants.</p><p>Then, MALIBAL got into a conversation with another member of the coreboot leadership, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-devillier-889370143/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Matt DeVillier</a>, who works for AMD, and is based out of Texas. After some back and forth, they agreed to work together to get the job done.</p><p>According to MALIBAL, Matt was always delaying the work and <strong>had damaged a laptop sent by them</strong> during the course. As a result, they also banned <a href="https://portal.malibal.com/kb/a1059/why-dont-you-offer-any-amd-processors-or-graphics/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">AMD</a> and the state of <a href="https://portal.malibal.com/kb/a1058/why-dont-you-ship-to-texas/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Texas</a> for life.</p><p>At the end of their blog post, MALIBAL points out that:</p><blockquote>In all of our correspondence with these coreboot developers, we went out of our way to get along. But despite our best efforts, and putting up with all of their nonsense, we were ultimately thrown to the curb like trash.</blockquote><blockquote>Which is why anyone who supports the coreboot project after the post date on this article, including contributing code, being a member of their boards, or donating will be banned for life without exception.</blockquote><p>MALIBAL also pointed out that if they had been successful in porting coreboot support for their laptops, they had planned to help out other companies by showing how to get it done without others having to endure &#x201C;<em>the same incompetence and cartel-like dealings</em>&#x201D;.</p><h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3><p>If the events described by MALIBAL took place like that, then <strong>the coreboot project needs to reevaluate their consultants and their communication</strong> because, as professionals, they shouldn&apos;t be treating their clients like that.</p><p>On the other hand, <strong>MALIBAL banning entire regions doesn&apos;t seem like a well-thought-out decision either</strong>. It&apos;s like cutting off ties with the entire country of New Zealand because one didn&apos;t spot a <a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Hobbits?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Hobbit</a>; it&#x2019;s absurd.</p><p><em>&#x1F4AC; Do you own a MALIBAL device?
