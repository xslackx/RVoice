Still, quite often due to their relative simplicity, they&#8217;re little more than a microcontroller board and a few components hanging off some wires. <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/196357-picoglitcher" target="_blank">PicoGlitcher</a> by Hackaday.IO user [Matthias Kesenheimer] is a simple voltage glitcher which aims to make the hardware setup a little more robust without getting caught up in the complexities of other techniques. Based on the Raspberry Pico (obviously!), the board has sufficient niceties to simplify glitching attacks in various situations, providing controllable host power if required.</p>
<p>A pair of <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LVC8T245" target="_blank">74LVC8T245</a> (according to the <a href="https://github.com/MKesenheimer/fault-injection-library/blob/master/schematics/pico-glitcher-v1.1-BOM.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">provided BoM</a>) level shifters allow connecting to targets at voltages from 1.8 V to 5 V if powered by PicoGlitcher or anything in spec for the &#8216;245 if target power is being used. In addition to the expected RESET and TRIGGER signals, spare GPIOs are brought out to a header for whatever purpose is needed to control a<img decoding="async" data-attachment-id="730882" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2024/10/30/use-picoglitcher-for-voltage-glitching-attacks/voltag-glitching/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/voltag-glitching.webp" data-orig-size="1503,1209" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="voltag-glitching" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;https://fault-injection-library.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/&lt;/p&gt;
" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/voltag-glitching.webp?w=400" data-large-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/voltag-glitching.webp?w=777" tabindex="0" role="button" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-730882" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/voltag-glitching.webp?w=400" alt="" width="400" height="322" srcset="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/voltag-glitching.webp 1503w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/voltag-glitching.webp?resize=250,201 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/voltag-glitching.webp?resize=400,322 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/voltag-glitching.webp?resize=777,625 777w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /> particular attack. If a programmed reset doesn&#8217;t get the job done, the target power is provided via a TPS2041 load switch to enable cold starts. The final part of the interface is an analog input provided by an SMA connector.</p>
<p>The glitching signal is also brought out to an SMA connector via a pair of transistors; an <a href="https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/irlml2502pbf.pdf?fileId=5546d462533600a401535668048e2606" target="_blank">IRLML2502</a> NMOS performs &#8216;low power&#8217; glitching by momentarily connecting the glitch output to ground. This &#8216;crowbarring&#8217; causes a rapid dip in supply voltage and upsets the target, hopefully in a helpful way. An <a href="https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/irf7807pbf.pdf?fileId=5546d462533600a40153560823871cd7" target="_blank">IRF7807</a> &#8216;NMOS device provides a higher power option, which can handle pulse loads of up to 66A. Which transistor you select in the Findus glitching toolchain depends on the type of load connected, particularly the amount of decoupling capacitance that needs to be discharged. For boards with heavier decoupling, use the beefy IRF7807 and accept the glitch won&#8217;t be as sharp as you&#8217;d like. For other hardware, the faster, smaller device is sufficient.</p>
<p>The software to drive PicoGlitcher <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">and the <a href="https://github.com/MKesenheimer/fault-injection-library/tree/master/schematics/kicad" target="_blank">hardware design files for KiCAD</a> are provided on the <a href="https://github.com/MKesenheimer/fault-injection-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">project GitHub page</a></span>. There also appears to be an Eagle project in there. You can&#8217;t have too much hardware documentation! For the software, check out <a href="https://fault-injection-library.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">the documentation</a> for a quick overview of how it all works and some nice examples against some targets known to be susceptible to this type of attack.</p>
<p>For a cheap way to <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/07/04/the-cheap-way-to-glitch-an-stm8-microcontroller/">glitch an STM8, you can just use a pile of wires</a>. But for something a bit more complicated, such as a Starlink user terminal, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/11/28/a-modchip-to-root-starlink-user-terminal-through-voltage-glitching/">you need something a bit more robust</a>. Finally, voltage glitching doesn&#8217;t always work, so the <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/01/15/glitch-your-way-to-reverse-engineering-glory-with-the-picoemp/">next tool you can reach for is a picoEMP</a>.</p>

All these robots had smarts, capability, and agency. More than that, though—they were faithful(ish) companions to humans, fulfilling what that role entails.</p>
<p>The thing is, we&#8217;re not gonna get robots like that unless somebody builds them. [Angela Sheehan] is a artist and an educator, and a maker—and she&#8217;s trying to create exactly that. She came down to the 2023 Hackaday Supercon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHKO3xVTp0Y" target="_blank">to tell us all about her efforts to create cuddly companion bots for real.</a></p>

<p>You might remember Angela from her 2019 Supercon costume—she showed up dressed as <a href="https://www.gellacraft.com/colorfairy" target="_blank">a color-changing fairy</a>. In fact, she has dabbled in all kinds of fields, which has given her a broad skillset applicable to creating companion bots. She&#8217;s done lots of costuming and cosplay over the years, she&#8217;s worked in product design, and she brands herself a bit of a fashion hacker. These skills might not be particularly relevant to building a high-speed industrial robot arm to perform 2000 welds an hour. However, they come in absolute clutch when you&#8217;re trying to build a robot that acts as a soft, cuddly companion. She notes that she was inspired to create her own companion bots by the work of others formerly showcased by Hackaday—you might remember work in this field from <a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/alex-glow/">Alex Glow and Jorvon Moss.</a></p>

<p>Angela&#8217;s talk soon tackles the elephant in the room—from the drop, you&#8217;ve probably been wondering about the cute critter perched on her shoulder. The long-tailed creature is named Nova, and she&#8217;s remarkably friendly and soothing once you get to know her.</p>
<p>Development took some time, with Angela doing lots of research and development to create the Nova we see today. &#8220;I actually did a lot of the prototyping and field testing for this bot in the library makerspace that I work at,&#8221; she explains. &#8220;It was great to see people who don&#8217;t know the inside and out of technology interact with [Nova] and I could pinpoint the moment that she became alive to people.&#8221; The bot got quite a response, transcending the level of basic machine to something a little more. &#8220;People wanted to come in and visit her and pet her,&#8221; says Angela. &#8220;That was such a powerful moment&#8230; that happened as soon as I started putting a face on her.&#8221; Angela doesn&#8217;t just tell the tale—during the talk, she passes Nova to the audience so they can interact with her up close. She explains that this is something that she does regularly—and we get to see photos of the lovely interactions Nova has had with dozens of smiling, happy people.</p>

She explains how components like Nova&#8217;s wings were first drafted in Adobe Illustrator. From there, the structure was refined into actual models in Fusion 360, while a PCB was developed in Eagle for the lighting electronics.</p>
<p>The face, though, was perhaps most crucial—as is the case for any anthropomorphic character. She took inspiration from Toothless from <em>How To Train Your Dragon,</em> using a stuffed toy as reference. Initial attempts weren&#8217;t particularly satisfying though, so she learned 3D sculpting for a further attempt in clay. Feedback from Twitter helped her develop the face further into the Nova we see today. The eyes were sourced from an Etsy supplier specializing in doll eyes. Angela notes there&#8217;s some magic there—when backlit with LEDs, switching them on and off can create a really believable blink pattern that feels super realistic. &#8220;What are those elements that make it feel alive?&#8221; Angela muses. &#8220;There are just little pieces of the psychology of it that you can dial into and you can make something that feels very alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>The talk then covers the rest of the design that helps create the &#8220;illusion of life.&#8221; Angela explains using servos and a robot gripper mechanism to flap the wings, and dialing in the motion so it felt as authentic as possible. She also covers robustness, designing &#8220;cuddle-worthy&#8221; bodies, and the value of designing for modularity. There&#8217;s also a useful discussion about how to make these builds more accessible, including useful starting points like which microcontroller and code platforms are good to use.</p>
<p>Even better, we get a look into the companion bot community, and we learn about the emotional impact these robots can have. Sometimes that&#8217;s intentional, other times, it&#8217;s down to a happy accident. &#8220;There is an unintended effect with [Nova&#8217;s] servos, that it feels like a purr,&#8221; says Angela. &#8220;It&#8217;s very comforting right on your shoulder, and I was thinking maybe I should try and insulate it a little bit, but actually people love it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fundamentally, companion bots are a bit like virtual reality. We&#8217;ve seen a ton of products make big promises over the years, but we&#8217;ve never seen a killer app. However, as [Angela] demonstrates, it&#8217;s very possible to create something very real and very lovable if you pay attention to the right things. Perhaps it&#8217;s the personal touch that makes DIY companion bots so seemingly lifelike in a way that Furby never was.</p>
<p>In any case, if you&#8217;ve ever wanted a robot companion of your very own, there&#8217;s no reason you can&#8217;t start building your own. With maker skills, enthusiasm, and the will to succeed, you can create a fun and cuddly robot critter that has that magical spark of life.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9zNtQTpbms" target="_blank">Stencil Fix V1</a> used a shop vac for suction, just like <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/12/22/stencil-vacuum-assist-helps-avoid-the-heartbreak-of-smeared-solder-paste/">another stencil holder</a> we&#8217;ve seen. The vacuum can take up precious space, makes the jig a little tricky to move, and bumping the hose can lead to the dreaded smear and colorful language. To get around this [Max] added a brushless drone motor with a 3D printed impeller, with a LiPo battery for power. The speed controller gets its PWM signal from a little RP2040 dev board connected to a potentiometer. [Max] could have used a servo tester, but he found the motor could be a little too responsive and would move the entire unit due to inertia from the impeller. The RP2040 allowed him to add a low pass filter to eliminate the issue. The adjustable speed also means the suction force can be reduced a little for easy alignment of the stencil before locking it down completely.</p>
<p>We love seeing tool projects like these that make future projects a little easier. Fortunately, [Max] made the designs available so you can build your own.</p>

Most of it is of our own making, with cell phones, microwaves, WiFi, and broadcasts up and down the spectrum whizzing around all the time. But our transmissions aren&#8217;t the only RF show in town, as the Earth itself is more than capable of generating radio signals of its own, signals which you can explore with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsCtz7mDVw8" target="_blank">a simple sferics receiver like this one</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never heard of sferics and other natural radio phenomena, we have <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/11/06/sferics-whistlers-and-the-dawn-chorus-listening-to-earth-music-on-vlf/">a primer</a> to get you started. Briefly, sferics, short for &#8220;atmospherics,&#8221; are RF signals in the VLF range generated by the millions of lightning discharges that strike the Earth daily. Tuning into them is a pretty simple proposition, as [DX Explorer]&#8217;s receiver demonstrates. His circuit, which is based on a design by [K8TND], is just a single JFET surrounded by a few caps and resistors, plus a simple trap to filter out the strong AM broadcast signals in his area. The output of the RF amplifier goes directly into an audio amp, which could be anything you have handy &#8212; but you risk breaking [Elliot]&#8217;s heart if you don&#8217;t use his <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/12/07/you-can-have-my-lm386s-when-you-pry-them-from-my-cold-dead-hands/">beloved LM386</a>.</p>
<p>This is definitely a &#8220;nothing fancy&#8221; build, with the RF section built ugly style on a scrap of PCB and a simple telescopic whip used for an antenna. Tuning into the Earth&#8217;s radio signals does take some care, though. Getting far away from power lines is important, to limit AC interference. [DX Explorer] also found how he held the receiver was important; unless he was touching the ground plane of the receiver, the receiver started self-oscillating. But the pips, crackles, and pings came in loud and clear on his rig; check out the video below for the VLF action.</p>

This last feature is powered by SpaceAPI, a standard way for hackerspaces to publish information about themselves, including whether or not they are closed.</p>
<p>Given such a trove of data then it&#8217;s hardly surprising that [S3lph] would use it to create <a href="https://wiki.ccc-basel.ch/index.php/SpaceAPI-Karte" target="_blank">a gigantic map of central Europe with lights in the appropriate places</a> (German language, <a href="https://wiki-ccc--basel-ch.translate.goog/index.php/SpaceAPI-Karte?_x_tr_sl=nl&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank">Google Translate link</a>) to show the spaces and their status.</p>
<p>The lights are a set of addressable LEDs and the brain is an ESP32, making this an accessible project for most hackers with the time to assemble it. Unsurprisingly then it&#8217;s not the first such map we&#8217;ve seen, though it&#8217;s considerably more ambitious than <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/02/06/dutch-hackerspaces-at-ten-years-old-celebrating-a-community-with-a-special-map/">the last one</a>. Meanwhile if your hackerspace doesn&#8217;t have SpaceAPI yet or you&#8217;re simply curious about the whole thing, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/06/18/do-you-spaceapi/">we took a look at it back in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks [Dave] for the tip.</p>

<p>While the first real application of an electric motor was Ben Franklin&#8217;s electrostatically-driven turkey rotisserie, electromagnetic type motors largely supplanted the technology due to the types of materials available to engineers of the time. Newer dielectric fluids and power electronics now allow electrostatic motors to be better at some applications than their electromagnetic peers.</p>
<p>The main advantage of electrostatic motors is their reduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_raw_materials" target="_blank">critical materials use</a>. In particular, electrostatic motors don&#8217;t require <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/01/10/mining-and-refining-copper-the-metal-that-built-technology/">copper</a> windings or any <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/06/04/rare-earth-metals-caught-in-trade-war/">rare earth magnets</a> which are getting more expensive as demand grows for electrically-powered machines. C-Motive is initially targeting direct drive industrial applications, and the &#8220;<a href="https://ludois.wempec.wisc.edu/electric-machines/" target="_blank">voltage driven nature of an electrostatic machine</a>&#8221; means they require less cooling than an electromagnetic motor. They also don&#8217;t use much if any power when stalled.</p>

<p>We have probably all seen the marketing blurbs on packaging and elsewhere promoting the amazing lifespan of LED lighting solutions. Theoretically you should be able to install a LED bulb in a fixture that used to hold that incandescent lightbulb which had to be replaced annually and have it last a decade or longer. Yet we seem to replace these LED bulbs much more often than that, with them suffering a range of issues. To get to the root cause of this, [The Doubtful Technician] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l1we3vwnzY" target="_blank">decided to perform an autopsy</a> on a couple of dead lightbulbs which he got from a variety of sources and brands.</p>
<p>One lamp is an Amazon-bought one from a seller who seems to have vanished, but was promised over 3 years of constant use. Other than the fun of blinding of oneself while testing, this one was easy to diagnose, with a dodgy solder joint on a resistor in a MELF package. The next one from Lowes was very dim, and required popping open with some gentle force, which revealed as likely culprit a shorted SMD resistor. Finally a more substantial (i.e. heavier) bulb was tested which had survived about 7 years in the basement until it and its siblings began to suddenly die. Some might consider this the normal lifespan, but what really failed in them?</p>
<p>The electronics in this last bulb were the most impressive, with a full switch mode power supply (SMPS) that appears to have suffered a failure. Ultimately the pattern with these three bulbs was that while the LEDs themselves were still fine, it were things like the soldering joints and singular components on the LED driver PCB that had failed. Without an easy way to repair these issues, and with merely opening the average LED lightbulb being rather destructive, this seems like another area where what should be easy repairs are in fact not, and more e-waste is created.</p>
