        <title>[$] An update on Apple M1/M2 GPU drivers</title>

        <description>The kernel graphics driver for the Apple M1 and M2 GPUs is, rather
famously, written in Rust, but it has achieved conformance with
various graphics standards, which is also noteworthy.  At the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/6/&quot;&gt;X.Org Developers Conference
(XDC)&amp;nbsp;2024&lt;/a&gt;, Alyssa Rosenzweig gave an update on the status of the
driver, along with some news about the kinds of games it can support (&lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtLP5sAXYKo&quot;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/6/contributions/284/attachments/230/310/slides.pdf &quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;).
There has been lots of progress since her talk at XDC last year (&lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36VFNdQHsE&quot;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;),
with, of course, still more to come.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thunderbird.net/2024/10/thunderbird-for-android-8-0-takes-flight/&quot;&gt;first stable release&lt;/a&gt; of the Thunderbird mail client for Android is now available:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
Just over two years ago, we &lt;a
href=&quot;https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/06/revealed-thunderbird-on-android-plans-k9/&quot;&gt;announced
our plans&lt;/a&gt; to bring Thunderbird to Android by taking K-9 Mail under
our wing. The journey took a &lt;a
href=&quot;https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/12/when-will-thunderbird-for-android-be-released/&quot;&gt;little
longer than we had originally anticipated&lt;/a&gt; and there was a lot to
learn along the way, but the wait is finally over! For all of you who
have ever asked &quot;when is Thunderbird for Android coming out?&quot;, the
answer is â€“ today!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is immediately available on the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.thunderbird.android&quot;&gt;Google
Play Store&lt;/a&gt;, via &lt;a
href=&quot;https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-android/releases/tag/THUNDERBIRD_8_0&quot;&gt;GitHub
Releases&lt;/a&gt;, or from the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://thunderbird.net/mobile/&quot;&gt;Thunderbird web site&lt;/a&gt;, and
it will be &quot;&lt;q&gt;coming soon&lt;/q&gt;&quot; to the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://f-droid.org/en/&quot;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; repository for FOSS Android
applications. See the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-android/releases/tag/THUNDERBIRD_8_0&quot;&gt;release
notes&lt;/a&gt; for detailed information about Thunderbird&amp;nbsp;8.0 for
Android.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Mozilla has
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/132.0/releasenotes/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the release of a new version of Firefox. This version has the usual mix of 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-55/&quot;&gt;
security fixes&lt;/a&gt; and new features, as well as a handful of deprecations. The release removes support for HTTP/2 Push, but adds hardware acceleration for SVGs, support for wide color gamuts on more platforms, and restores support for remote debugging via USB.

        <title>[$] A new approach to validating test suites</title>

The first program that Martin Pool ever wrote, he said, had bugs; the ones he's writing
now most likely have bugs too. The talk Pool gave at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://rustconf.com/&quot;&gt;RustConf&lt;/a&gt; this year was about a way to try
to write programs with fewer bugs. He has developed a tool called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mutants.rs/&quot;&gt;
cargo-mutants&lt;/a&gt; that highlights gaps in test coverage by identifying
functions that can be broken without causing any tests to fail.
This can be a valuable complement to other testing techniques,
he explained.

        <title>Flock: a Flutter fork</title>

        <description>A project called Flock has &lt;a
href=&quot;https://flutterfoundation.dev/blog/posts/we-are-forking-flutter-this-is-why/&quot;&gt;announced
its existence&lt;/a&gt;.  Flock is a fork of the Flutter user-interface toolkit
project, motivated by frustration with the resources that Google is putting
into Flutter.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	We describe Flock as &quot;Flutter+&quot;. In other words, we do not want, or
	intend, to fork the Flutter community. Flock will remain constantly
	up to date with Flutter. Flock will add important bug fixes, and
	popular community features, which the Flutter team either can't, or
	won't implement.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Debian Developer Russell Coker has &lt;a
href=&quot;https://etbe.coker.com.au/2024/10/26/cups-vulnerability/&quot;&gt;written
up&lt;/a&gt; an analysis of the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/991929/&quot;&gt;remote exploit of CUPS&lt;/a&gt;
announced in September:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seems to have a different experience to me of reporting bugs, I
have had plenty of success getting bugs fixed without hyping them. I
just report the bug, wait a while, and it gets fixed. [...] I
was quite confident that my systems wouldn't be at any risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was published my opinion was proven to be correct, &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.securityweek.com/highly-anticipated-linux-flaw-allows-remote-code-execution-but-less-serious-than-expected/&quot;&gt;it
turned out to be a series of CUPS bugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/&quot;&gt;Open Source Initiative&lt;/a&gt;
(OSI) has &lt;a
href=&quot;https://opensource.org/blog/the-open-source-initiative-announces-the-release-of-the-industrys-first-open-source-ai-definition&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;
the release of &lt;a
href=&quot;https://opensource.org/ai/open-source-ai-definition&quot;&gt;version
1.0&lt;/a&gt; of the Open Source AI Definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
The OSAID offers a standard by which community-led, open and public
evaluations will be conducted to validate whether or not an AI system
can be deemed Open Source AI. This first stable version of the OSAID
is the result of multiple years of research and collaboration, an
international roadshow of workshops, and a year-long co-design process
led by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LWN &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/995159/&quot;&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt; the
OSAID process, and final release candidate, on October 25.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Sparrow Li presented virtually at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://rustconf.com&quot;&gt;
RustConf&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;2024 about the current state of and
future plans for the Rust compiler's performance. The compiler is relatively slow to compile
large programs, although it has been getting better over time. The next big
performance improvement to come will be parallelizing the compiler's parsing,
type-checking, and related operations, but even after that, the project has
several avenues left to explore.

        <description>Rong Xu and
Han Shen described the kernel-optimization techniques that Google uses in the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lpc.events/event/18/sessions/180/#20240918&quot;&gt;toolchains
track&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lpc.events/event/18/page/224-lpc-2024-overview&quot;&gt;2024 Linux
Plumbers Conference&lt;/a&gt;.
They talked about &lt;a
href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45290.pdf&quot;&gt;automatic
feedback-directed optimization&lt;/a&gt; (AutoFDO), which can be used with the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://research.google/pubs/propeller-a-profile-guided-relinking-optimizer-for-warehouse-scale-applications/&quot;&gt;Propeller&lt;/a&gt;
optimizer to produce kernels with better performance using profile
information gathered from real workloads.  There is a fair amount of
overlap between these tools and the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/bolt#bolt&quot;&gt;BOLT&lt;/a&gt;
post-link optimizer, which was the subject of a &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/993828/&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; that directly preceded this session.

        <description>Linus has released &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/995980/&quot;&gt;6.12-rc5&lt;/a&gt; for testing.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	rc5 looks perfectly normal, and maybe even on the small side of
	normal. The diffstat looks nice and flat too, with the exception of
	the removal of the da8xx fbdev driver due to it having been
	replaced by the tilcdc driver. And I'm sure we're all thinking the
	same thing: &quot;What lovely descriptive driver names we have&quot;.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/&quot;&gt;Open Source Initiative&lt;/a&gt;
(OSI) has been working on defining &lt;a
href=&quot;https://opensource.org/ai&quot;&gt;Open Source AI&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;that is what
constitutes an AI system that can be used, studied, modified, and
shared for any purpose&amp;mdash;for almost two
years. Its &lt;a
href=&quot;https://opensource.org/about/board-of-directors&quot;&gt;board&lt;/a&gt; will
be voting on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/ai/drafts/the-open-source-ai-definition-1-0-rc2&quot;&gt;Open Source AI Definition&lt;/a&gt; (OSAID) on Sunday,
October&amp;nbsp;27, with the 1.0 version slated to be published on
October&amp;nbsp;28. It is never possible to please &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; in
such an endeavor, and it would be folly to make that a goal. However,
a number of prominent figures in the open-source community have voiced
concerns that OSI is setting the bar too low with the OSAID&amp;mdash;which
will undo decades of community work to cajole vendors into adhering to
or respecting the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/osd&quot;&gt;Open Source
Definition&lt;/a&gt; (OSD).&lt;/p&gt;
